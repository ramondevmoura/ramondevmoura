# Hi, I'm Ramon Moura # ðŸ‘‹


**I am a full-stack and entrepreneur** 

<sub>
I'm a self-taught person passionate about learning, I've been working as a full stack developer for 2 years, I started my journey as a programmer in order to test my ideas, at that time I couldn't afford to pay a professional, so I decided to learn to program.
After a lot of practice and study, I started to develop my own applications and systems, from the backend to the frontend.
In addition to testing my ideas, I also help entrepreneurs put two ideas on the battlefield.
